# Nummix
 
Creating Nummix my main goal was to create fully functional small mobile game using Unreal Engine 5.3. The gameplay is simple. Swipe the cube to pick up mathematical operations with numbers. Player has to get on his cube the same number as shown at the top of the screen. After that new goal is shown and the level is ends when there are no more numbers on 25 squares.




My goals:

- Create as much as possible using c++ (only UsersWidget created using blueprint class)
- Focus on UE c++ API 

Main Features:

- Each level is fully generated
- 3 levels of difficulty
- Implemented ads: banner and interstitial (used Bansh Ads plugin)
- Working In-App-Purchase (repaired  of unfinished implementation of UE_5.3 IAP system)
